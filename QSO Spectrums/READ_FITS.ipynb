    "# 1.  The IGM - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The IGM makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve, as galaxies accrete their star forming material in part from the H I reservoirs that surround them.  The IGM is low density but by no means deserted.  Rather strikingly, if you sum up the total mass in stars in the present-day universe, it equates to $<$10% of the total number of baryons expected from cosmic nucleosynthesis and from observations of the CMB.  Some of this baryonic inventory is made up by the cool and cold gas in galaxies, and some other part of it by the hot gas in the centers of clusters of galaxies, but even then we are still missing about $\\sim$50% of the total number of baryons.  We look to the IGM to find these missing baryons.  Let us study the IGM in two ways:  (1) by absorption towards bright background objects, and (2) by emission.\n",

    "The universe cools as it expands.  By a redshift of $z \\sim 1300$, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) cooled below 10,000 K, enabling the combination of the first neutral atoms.  We call this the epoch of \"recombination\" (although it really an epoch of \"first combination\").  Moving along, the CMB continues to cool as it expands as given by the function $T_{\\gamma} = 2.736(1+z)$ K.  Also, a difference arises between the temperatures of the baryons and the photons, in the sense that the baryons cool faster.  This probably happened because not every single electron recombined.  As a result, a small fraction of free electrons was able transfer a large amount of energy from the CMB to the gas by Compton scattering.  This process would succeed to keep the baryon and photon temperatures the same until a redshift of $z \\sim 150$. We think the electrons will never recombine at the 100% level, with the probability of the recombination rate decreasing with cosmic time due to cosmological expansion. At the epoch when the recombination rate becomes less than the expansion rate, the number of ionized electrons levels off at an ionization fraction of $X_e \\equiv n_e/n \\sim 10^{-5}-10^{-3}$.  As the standard lore goes, cosmic time progresses until $z \\approx 6.5$ when the universe subsequently reionizes in an event called the \"epoch of reionization.\"  Is this story correct?  If so, then when, and how, and with which sources, did this happen?  \n",
    "   \n",
    "A powerful approach to study the IGM is to consider the absorption properties towards a bright background source. This observational technique is sensitive to low column density absorption systems.  It is also limited in that we must probe foreground objects only by making use of the \"randomly\" situated bright background sources that are given to us.  Say a source at  redshift $z_e$ and frequency $\\nu$ has luminosity $\\mathcal{L}(\\nu)d\\nu$.  If the light propagates in a vacuum then the flux at $z=0$ is:  $F(\\nu)d\\nu = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}[\\nu(1+z_e)]}{4\\pi d_L^2}(1+z_e)d\\nu$, where $d_L$ is the luminosity distance.  This just says that the spectral energy distribution is stretched by the cosmological expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now then, if we introduce a purely absorbing gas, then some photons will get scattered out of the line-of-sight.  This provides a source of opacity, $\\tau$.  We can write an expression for this attenuation of light as: \n",
    "$n_{\\gamma}(\\nu_e,t) = e^{-\\tau} n_{\\gamma}(\\nu_e,t_e)$, where $n_{\\gamma}(\\nu_e,t_e)$ is the number density of photons at the source at frequency $\\nu_e$ and time $t_e$, and \n",
    "$n_{\\gamma}(\\nu_e,t)$ is the number density of photons observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption often takes place in bound transitions between energy states $E_1$ and $E_2$, such that $E_2 > E_1$.  This transition requires a photon with a frequency corresponding to this energy difference of $\\nu_{12} \\equiv (E_2-E_1)/h$.  The excited electron will then emit light by spontaneous or stimulated emission as it falls back down to the ground state.  Note given the rarefied nature of the IGM, and the efficiency of the radiative processes, most of the time the electrons will be in the ground state.  Of the emission options, spontaneous emission scatters light randomly in all directions, while stimulated emission propagates in the direction of the light source.  We write the mean optical depth at observed \n",
    "frequency $\\nu_0$ as the sum of pure absorption and the (opposing) stimulated emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the wavelength of the Ly$\\alpha$ line at a rest wavelength of 1216 Anstroms the light from a background source gets readily absorbed by the diffuse IGM.  By the \"Ly$\\alpha$ forest\"\n",
    "we refer to the set of absorption lines along the line-of-sight seen towards the bright source (often a QSO).  One Ly$\\alpha$ absorption line appears for each H I absorbing cloud along the line-of-sight, which means the absorption is stretched out to different wavelengths.  The sum total of all the H I absorption gives us a measure of the H I opacity, which is a strong function of redshift.  At high redshifts, $z \\gtrsim 6.5$, the absorption is complete (or nearly-so in many cases).  We interpret this to mean that the IGM contains bound H I atoms at the level of $10^{-3}$ or lower.  For $z < 6.5$, the becomes incomplete (patchy).  The absorption pattern often appears as a set of dozens of individual absorption lines comprising the \"trees\" of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest.  The overall depression of the\n",
    "mean continuum level provided by the Ly$\\alpha$ forest absorption relative to the unattenuated spectrum is referred to as the \"Gunn-Peterson\" effect.  In sum, the Ly$\\alpha$% forest is densely populated with absorption at higher redshifts, and thins out towards lower redshifts.  We can compute the effective H I opacity, $\\tau_{eff}$, observationally for a given sightline.  The method is straightforward.  The procedure is to estimate the flux in the continuum $F_{cont}(\\lambda)$, and the flux in the observed\n",
    "spectrum $F_{obs}(\\lambda)$.  One then computes $\\tau_{eff}$ as:  $ \\tau_{eff} = - ln \\big (\\frac{<F_{obs}(\\lambda)>}{<F_{cont}(\\lambda)>} \\big )$.  Let's compute $\\tau$ for an actual QSO from the Sload Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)!\n"

This function gives the ionizing background in the absence of an IGM. On taking absorption by H atoms in the IGM into account, the total attentuation is shown by the solid line.  This function shows two prominent continuum breaks which correspond to the H I ionization edge (1 Ryd) and the He II ionization edge (~4 Ryd), respectively.  Note, for those unfamiliar with this unit, 1 Ryd is the wavenumber equating to the ionization energy.  \n",

Since the additional source of UV photons is the culprit, one can use the proximity effect as a means to measure $J(\\nu)$ for the UV background.   We can get $J(\\nu)$ for the QSO from the QSO luminosity and spectrum.  Then based on the size of the proximity zone, and the properties of the QSO, we can solve for UV background component.

    "### 1.3  The Evolution of the IGM\n",
    "\n",
    "If we imagine regions of the IGM as a Newtonian fluid, then IGM properties can be explored using the standard fluid equations (see Appendix B in MvDBW for more details).  For a start, we need to know the sources of heating and cooling.  A primary heating source is photoionization, for which a photon ionizes an atom, with the extra energy transferred into the motion of the electron.  If the IGM started out cold, then it can heat up by photoionization, but only to a temperature of $T \\sim 3 \\times 10^4$ K.  In the absence of any other heating or cooling sources, it will subsequently cool owing to the adiabatic expansion of the universe.  For class, review why photoionization of gas clouds work only up to $T \\sim 3 \\times 10^4$ K?  Which process(es) prevent photoionization from heating up the gas to still higher temperatures? \n",
    "\n",
    "A thermal cloud that is able to reach high temperatures of $\\simeq T \\sim 3 \\times 10^4$ K can cool by using the high number of electrons in the cloud by Compton-scattering off of incident CMB photons.  It works as follows:  a typical thermal gas cloud has free electrons at temperature $T_e$, such that $k_B T_e <<m_e c^2$.  In free-free interactions, CMB photons exchange energy with electrons in the cloud.  For a photon temperature $T_{\\gamma}$ such that $T_{\\gamma}<<T_e$, the result is that the exiting photon will carry away the excess energy.  This process is called \"Compton cooling.\"  The caveat is that the mechanism only works if the Compton cooling time is smaller than the age of the universe $t_{cool} < t$.  This condition is met for a typical cloud at $z_{comp} \\approx 6$.  Now then, thermal clouds that are heated above the typical $T$ can cool back down to the nominal $\\sim3 \\times 10^4$ K by Compton cooling provided that the heating took place at $z>z_{comp}$.  Otherwise, this cooling mechanism is insufficient and the cloud will maintain its temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second heating source is shock-heating.  The collapse of matter as a result of density perturbations will shock-heat the entrained gas into a 2D disk-like structure, or\n",
    "into a narrow cosmic filament, or into a dark matter halo.  The temperatures of this Warm-Hot Medium (WHIM) should reach $\\sim 10^{5-6}$ K.  At such temperatures, H will be completely ionized.  Even so, this region has been probed using hydrogen-like ions of metals such as OVI and NV.  The experiment involves doing careful QSO absorption line studies in an approach similar to the first exercise of this Workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take first steps to understand a common heating source by reviewing the case of the expanding H II region.  We consider the simple case of a pure H I gas cloud of constant density.  If a single source of ionizing photons turns on in the center (a star), then this source will abruptly modify the physical conditions in the cloud.  We make the assumption that each source photon with a wavelength smaller than or equal to the Lyman-limit will ionize a single H-atom. This free electron will subsequently recombine to the ground state at a recombination rate per unit volume $\\mathcal{R}$, and then instantly get ionized again by the constant and relentless bath of ionizing photons produced at rate $\\dot{N}_{\\gamma}$.  The photoionization will heat up this new H II region to a temperature $T_I \\approx 10^4$ K.

    "where $n_f$ is the final number density of ions and $T_{II}$ is the final temperature of the gas.  The final radius of the expanding H II region is $r_f = r_i\\left ( \\frac{2T_{II}}{T_I} \\right )^{2/3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand reionization, \n",
    "we build and extend this expanding H II region scenario to larger scales.  At high redshifts, ($z > 10$), we can image a series of ionizing sources turning out in the centers of clouds.  We would expect that the few ionizing sources, and high IGM densities, would make H II regions at large physical separations.  Then, as more sources emerge and produce additional ionized regions, the regions would start to overlap with each other other Ultimately, the universe would completely re-ionize when the volume filling factor reached a value of one (see Barkana & Loeb; Ciardi & Ferrara 2005).\n",

As massive stars are clustered, within a short time (~$10^6$ yrs), another SN event takes place.  The SNe proximate H II regions overlap, and eventually overtake the entire IGM.  This figure comes from Barkana & Loeb 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now then, the recombination timescale is comparable to the Hubble time at $z \\approx 8$.  This means it is possible for a population of sources to reionize the universe at early times, recombine, and then ionize a second time at $z=6.5$.  Some have proposed that the so-called \"Pop III\" stars could have comprised of this early ionizing source.  Astronomers have long searched for this proposed population of sources which would have only existed at high redshifts.  It is possible that we will find Pop III stars using the JWST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the 21 cm spin-flip transition of H can be used to probe reionization directly, because the physical conditions arising in H gas that is heats up will change its spin temperature.  We will surely hear more about this powerful probe in the future as observatories such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) see first-light.

    "Supernovae (SNe) heat up the ISM into a hot phase, thereby suppressing the formation of another generation of stars.  We cover here the progenitors of SNe, then move on to discuss SN feedback, galactic winds and mass loading, modeling SN feedback, the evolution of blastwaves, and radiation pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Supernova Progenitors\n",
    "\n",
    "Supernovae are not all alike.  There are only two broad categories:  type Ia or Ib, and type II.  The latter type shows H absorption lines in the spectrum, and type Ia's show strong Si absorption.  It is important to review the SNa types as observations of SN Ia's in particular were used to make the startling discovery of universal acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "SN 1a: although occasionally there are still controversies, the concensus is that the progenitor is a C/O white dwarf in a binary system consisting also of a Main Sequence star.  In this scenario, material from the outer layers of the star overflows its Roche lobe and gets accreted onto the white dwarf.  This process ensues until the Chandrasekhar mass is reached, at which point the C and O fuse rapidly into heavier elements, up to Fe.  A SN 1a is produced.  This explosion is very efficient in that all the material returns to the ISM, with the understanding that no remnant is left behind.  SN 1a's can appear in any galaxy type, lending circumstantial evidence that SN 1a's are a product of evolved stars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The mass of the star that will become the white dwarf is probably in the range $2 \\lesssim M \\lesssim 8 M_{\\odot}$.  Interestingly, while the mass of this progenitor Main Sequence star is not well known, the masses of white dwarfs all weigh in at about $0.68 \\pm 0.13 M_{\\odot}$, with only a small scatter (Tremblay et al. 2016, MNRAS).  The reason for this narrow mass range is an open question.  The benefit of knowing the mass, and knowing that all of the WD participates in the explosion, means that each time a SN event takes place, it is the conversion of $\\sim 0.7 M_{\\odot}$ of material into energy.  Indeed the luminosities of SN Ia's produce luminosities over a narrow range about the vale $L_B = 9.6 \\times 10^9 L_{\\odot}$.  \n",

This implies that the galaxies that form inside the halos should have a similar mass function.  Instead, galaxies have a much shallower mass function which is $\\propto M^{-1}$ (Cole et al. 2001).  Heat injection from SNe can suppress the star formation at low masses.  Even so, this hot gas does cool off, which in the end can lead to the overproduction of stellar material (Benson et al. 2003).  This \"overcooling\" problem requires some additional source of heating to keep at least some of the gas out of the star formation cycle.  The natural mechanisms invoked to supply this heat are SNe, stellar winds, and AGN.\n",

This approach has the benefit of reproducing better the size-mass relation with disks (Dutton and van den Bosch 2009), and enrichment of the high redshift IGM (Oppenheimer and Davé 2006).  \n",
